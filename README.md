# vs_keymaps
My personal VS Code keymaps.

## Why?
I work in an office that uses Macs. I use Linux/Windows at home. These keyboard shortcuts are a disgusting amalgamation of pivotal shortcuts, poorly ported mac shortcuts to Windows/Linux, and a few others that I happen to like for some reason. I hate setting these shortcuts by hand, and as a result added them here mostly for my own use. I may add the MacOs version of these shortcuts eventually, or might not. If you for some reason know pivotal shortcuts really well, don't want to use the default VsCode shortcuts, and don't use a Mac at home, these shortcuts might be a good starting point for you.
